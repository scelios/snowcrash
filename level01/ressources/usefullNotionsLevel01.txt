The SCP command :

The scp command is used to securely copy files between hosts on a network.

This command can be used from the host to copy files from the VM
or to send files to the VM

So to copy files form the VM the commandline is :

-> scp -P XXXX VmIpAddress@localhost:/path/to/the/file/in/the/vm/filename 
/path/in/the/host/

And to send a file from the host to the VM :

-> scp -P XXXX /local/path/to/the/file/filename 
VmIpAddress@localhost:/destination/path/in/the/VM
