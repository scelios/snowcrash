to install john the ripper in the school computer I first went to github

https://github.com/openwall/john

I copied the HTTPS link there and git cloned it 

For the instalation I followed these steps :

go in the john directory, then go in src and run :

./configure && make -s clean && make -sj4

then go to the run directory :

cd ../run

to check if john is working well run :

./john --test

then I ran john giving it the file containing the text to crack :

./john /home/ncardozo/Documents/SnowCrash/rendu/level01/ressources/JTR.txt
