.pcap file or Packet Capture

It is a file that contains a network capture (the packets that have circulated on an interface).

It is generated by tools such as tcpdump or Wireshark.

Inside, you can see:

source/destination IP addresses,

protocols used (HTTP, FTP, etc.),

and sometimes... passwords transmitted in plain text 😏.
