* Type of encryption used :

	Caesar cipher or Caesar code (in french "code CÃ©sar") :
	
	Is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is 				replaced by another letter a few places further along in the alphabet (i.e., shifted but always the same for the same message).

	The shift distance is chosen based on a number called the offset, which can be to the right (A to B) or to the left (B to A).

	For any shift to the right (by +N), there is an equivalent shift 		to the left (by 26-N) because the alphabet rotates on itself. The Caesar cipher is sometimes called a rotation cipher.
