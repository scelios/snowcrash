Lua :

Small, lightweight, embeddable scripting language commonly used
to configure apps/games, extend programs (C API), or write 
utilities.

Its syntax is simple : functions, tables (equivalent to dicts/objects),
loops, require, dofile, etc.

Lua scripts can execute system code if the author has used functions
such as os.execute, io.popen, loadstring/load (dynamic evaluation), 
or dofile on controllable files â†’ exploitation vectors.

We often search for the following in a .lua file: file paths, flag 
keywords, calls to os.*, io.*, load, require, and any file reading.
