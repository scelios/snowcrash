# SnowCrash - Cybersecurity Challenge

## Overview

SnowCrash is a school cybersecurity project consisting of multiple levels where participants must exploit various vulnerabilities and crack security mechanisms to retrieve flags. Each level presents different security challenges including password cracking, binary exploitation, privilege escalation, and reverse engineering.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple levels, each containing:
- `flag`: The target flag file to retrieve
- `ressources/` or `Ressources/`: Additional resources and documentation
  - `help.md`: Level-specific hints and guidance
  - Various other files with useful information

## Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**: Analyze the target system and identify potential attack vectors
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Look for security weaknesses in executables, configurations, or permissions
3. **Exploitation**: Execute attacks to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges
4. **Flag Retrieval**: Extract the target flag from protected resources

## Tools and Techniques

Common tools and techniques used throughout the challenges:
- Binary analysis and reverse engineering
- Password cracking and brute force attacks
- Privilege escalation exploits
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- File system permission exploitation
- Network security assessment

## Environment

- **Platform**: Virtual Machine (VM) environment
- **Operating System**: Linux-based system
- **Access Method**: SSH or direct console access

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding common security vulnerabilities
- Practical experience with penetration testing tools
- Development of ethical hacking skills
- Knowledge of system security hardening
- Hands-on experience with real-world attack scenarios

## Security Note

This project is for educational purposes only. All techniques and exploits demonstrated should only be used in authorized testing environments and never against systems without explicit permission.

*This project demonstrates practical cybersecurity skills through hands-on exploitation of intentionally vulnerable systems in a controlled educational environment.*
